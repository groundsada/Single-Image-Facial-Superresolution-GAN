# Single-Image-Facial-Superresolution-GAN

A machine learning project for IIT CS 584 focusing on generating high resolution face images from low resolution images. The project proposes a controllable generative face super resolution framework that can construct faithful face images with realistic details, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance. The framework is composed of an encoder-generator architecture, a style modulator, and a facial modulator and is end-to-end trainable and converges fast.
